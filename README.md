# Hyprland Dots

This is my personal configuration of my system.

Initially started as fork of https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots (thank you for some starting point). However I don't agree with "Suggest NOT to assign a keybind which I set on the default Keybinds". I want my system to behave exactly as I want. Whats the point in switching from Windows to Linux if you can't even change your keybinds??

## Notes to future me

Restore from repo:
1. clone repo into ~/.config
2. Create symlinks:
    1. `ln -s ~/.config/.zshrc .zshrc`
    2. `ln -s ~/.config/.oh-my-zsh .oh-my-zsh`
